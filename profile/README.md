[The VGER Group](https://thevgergroup.com)

Having worked in small, medium, large and gigantic companies we decided it was time to take the reins for bit and build the company that we wanted to work for.

We're geeky, nerdy, experienced in everything from engineering, architecture, data science, global scaled design, product development and we have partners for the areas that we might not have the experience in. 

We are big fans and contributors to the Open Source Arena, and have been for several decades, with contributions in Apache, solr, lucene, plotly, just to name a few.

### What do we do
We primarily focus on Data and AI, how to get data, enhance it, make it available, deliver insights from it, and build AI solutions around it.

But we also go further in assisting companies with understanding and advising on how to build their business around data and AI. To become fluent in the world of data. 

We often help with analysis, roadmap development, and application development especially with startups that might not have the product development background needed to get ideas off the ground. But at the end of the day we build products and solutions.

### Contributing to our code
Where possible we will use either Apache2 or MIT licenses which allows you to fork and work on your own copy. But we encourage you to contribute back to these main repos so others may benefit and long term support may be provided. Applying patches with every upgrade isn't fun.

However in doing so, we ask that you abide by Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
It's simple, this isn't the place for trolling, exploitation, or generally being a goober.
